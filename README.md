# portfolio

This assignment was a little more difficult, but that was mainly because of timing. It was a big week at work and this was an assignment that needed a lot of time. 

The grids were tricky. They took me a while to get everything on my about me page situated in the way I wanted them. They still aren't exactly the way I have it envisioned in my head, so that's something I want to keep working on. I know this is something that we'll keep coming back to, so I expect that by the end of the class I'll like what I'm able to create a lot more. 

I ended up only using one media query to accomplish what I wanted for small view ports. I really enjoy how straightforward bootstrap is to work with. 

There were a few things that I really wanted to mess around with more, like ways to continue to improve the look of my site as it got smaller, but as of right now it's a little out of my grasp. I'm going to keep coming back to it. 

I really want to put a font awesome icon in a footer, but that's going to take a little more time to figure out. I found the code for a sticky footer, but the margins aren't working correctly. 

I assume at some point I'm going to want to change the size of my portfolio pictures, but since I currently have not that much to put in my portfolio, I'm not going to do that yet.
