## Description
I was happy to take this opportunity to update my portfolio. It looks almost exactly how I want it. I think there are some more Javascript elements I would like to add, but I'm very happy with how it turned out.

For my portfolio, I really wanted everything to be on one page. I was looking for something a little more sleek than what I had last time.  

Finding [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) and using that css framework was really a godsend. I was able to create the kind of flow I wanted using their heros and sections frameworks.  

### How my portfolio populates  
![gif](/Assets/portfolio.gif)  

Using Javascript and jQuery I was able to create a dynamic way to show off my projects in my portfolio section. I'm particularly proud of that. I used an object with my project info to dynamically populate the card. Eventually I'd like the card to appear and disappear, but I'm not sure of the best way to do that without making the page feel a bit choppy currently.
